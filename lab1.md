##Command `cd`
1. Using the Command with no argument
   The working directory is in /home, which is in the home page, starting directory

   The cd command allow us to change directory, this time we provide a path, which allow us to change our working directory.
   No error has occur, we successfully change our directory to the one we want.

3. Using the command with a path to a filen as an arugment
  The Working directory is in home directory
  The cd command is for us to change directory, but this time the path we provide is to a file, thus the command cannot do the thing we want, error message pop up, remind us that the path we entered is not a directory, cd command cannot do anything with the path provided.
  Error has occur, Error message shows that the path I enter is not a directory. The error occur is becuase the cd command only allow us to change a directory, is for us to move between directorys, but the arugment we enter wants to change to a file instead of a directory, thsu the error message tells us that the path we enter is not a directory.
