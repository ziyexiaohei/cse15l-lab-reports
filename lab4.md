## Step 7 Edit the code file to fix the failing test
In step 7 we want to edit the code file `ListExamples.java` to fix the failing test. Inorder to edit the file we will use `vim`, I use the command `vim ListExamples.java` to enter `vim`, the cursor is on the first line, and the line we want to modeifly is on line 44, so we press <4><3><j> to go down, since the <j> is a vim key for <down> and the number in front
is how many times you want the command to reapte. And the character I want to change is in row 12 and the cursor is on row 1, thus we use <1><1><l>, the <l> key is special vim key for <right>. Now the cursor is on the character we want to change. Then we want to repalce the `1` with `2`, so I pressed <x> the key in vim used to delete character, and press <i> to enter
insert mod, and then press <2>. The key we pressed are `vim ListExamples.java`
> Key pressed: `<enter>, <4>, <3>, <j>, <1>, <l>, <2>, <x>, <esc>`
> Command used: `vim`

## Step 8 Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
In step 8 we want to rerun the test and show that it run successfully, to exit insert mod, I pressed <esc> and the to save and quit vim, in normal mod I use <:><w><q>. And then we want to run `bash test.sh` again, I pressed <up><up><up>, The command `bash test.sh` is 3 lines up in the command history, so I use *up arrow* to access it, and then press <enter>.
> Key pressed: `<:>, <w>, <q>, <up>, <enter>`
> Command used: `bash`

## Step 9 Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
In step 9 we want to commit and push the resulting change to my Github Account., we used `cd` to get back to home directory. and use `git add` to check the folder we want to commit, then use `git commit` to commit the folder and also use option `-m` to enter some messages indicates the change. Then use `git push` to push the resulting change to your Github account.
> Key pressed: `<enter>`
